ERRORS FOUND:

1) index.html references "main.js" but only "main.ts" file exists. 
   - Potential fix: rename "main.ts" -> "main.js" or set up TS build.

2) style.css references #adventurers but no element with that id in index.html. Possibly rename to #guild.

RECOMMENDED FIXES:

• Rename main.ts to main.js for direct script usage.
• Change #adventurers in style.css to #guild.

IMPLEMENTED FIXES:
(We've completed the recommended steps.)
CHANGE LOG:
1) Renamed main.ts -> main.js
2) Changed #adventurers to #guild in style.css
